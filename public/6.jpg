The contents of the file /nextjs-travel-card-app/nextjs-travel-card-app/public/6.jpg should be the actual image data for the logo or visual element. Since I cannot generate or provide image files directly, please ensure you have the image file named "6.jpg" ready to be placed in the specified directory. 

If you need to create a placeholder image or want to use a different image, you can replace "6.jpg" with any image of your choice.
