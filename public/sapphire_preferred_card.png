The contents of the file /nextjs-travel-card-app/nextjs-travel-card-app/public/sapphire_preferred_card.png should be the actual image data for the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. Since I cannot generate or provide image files directly, please ensure that you have the image file named "sapphire_preferred_card.png" and place it in the specified directory. 

If you need to create a placeholder or a blank image file, you can create an empty PNG file using an image editing tool or a command line tool.
