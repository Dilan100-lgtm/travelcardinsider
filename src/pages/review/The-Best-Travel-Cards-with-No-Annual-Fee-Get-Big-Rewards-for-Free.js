          <section id="why-no-fee" className={styles.reviewSection}>
            <h2>1. Why Choose a No-Annual-Fee Travel Card?</h2>
            <p>
              If you travel only a few times a year or want <strong>flexible</strong> spending
              categories without the pressure of offsetting an annual fee, these cards are ideal.
              The savings on a typical $95–$495 annual fee can be re-routed toward flights, hotels,
              or additional purchases.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, no-fee cards often have <strong>solid sign-up bonuses</strong>, frequently
              in the range of 20,000–30,000 miles or points. While not as high as premium cards
              (which might offer 50k–100k), you’re still getting them for <strong>$0</strong>{' '}
              out-of-pocket each year.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* SECTION 2 */}
          <section id="key-benefits" className={styles.reviewSection}>
            <h2>2. Key Benefits &amp; Myths</h2>

            <h3>Myth #1: No-Fee Means Low Rewards</h3>
            <p>
              Actually, many no-fee travel cards offer <strong>1.5–2% back</strong> on all
              purchases, or elevated categories like 3% on dining or 2x miles on every purchase. The
              difference is that <strong>premium-tier</strong> versions might add lounge access or
              bigger multipliers in more categories. But <strong>base-level</strong> no-annual-fee
              cards can be surprisingly competitive for the average consumer.
            </p>

            <h3>Myth #2: No Travel Perks</h3>
            <p>
              Some no-fee cards come with <strong>auto rental coverage</strong>,{' '}
              <strong>trip cancellation insurance</strong>, and{' '}
              <strong>no foreign transaction fees</strong>— all very relevant to travelers. You
              might not get unlimited lounge visits or a $300 travel credit, but you can still snag
              robust day-to-day perks.
            </p>

            <h3>Myth #3: Lower Credit Limits</h3>
            <p>
              Card issuers often base credit limits on <strong>income, credit score</strong>, and
              overall risk, not strictly on whether the card has an annual fee. If you have
              excellent credit, you can still secure a healthy limit on many no-fee cards.

          <section id="top-picks" className={styles.reviewSection}>
            <h2>3. Top No-Annual-Fee Travel Card Picks for 2025</h2>

            <h3>a) Bank of America® Travel Rewards</h3>
            <p>
              This card <strong>earns 1.5 points per dollar</strong> on everything, with no fee and
              no foreign transaction fees. If you’re a Bank of America Preferred Rewards client, you
              can get an extra 25–75% reward bonus, effectively pushing it well above 2.5% on all
              spend. That’s a huge advantage if you already have savings or investments with BoA.
            </p>

            <h3>b) Wells Fargo Autograph℠ Card</h3>
            <p>
              With <strong>3x points</strong> on travel, dining, gas, transit, streaming, and phone
              plans, the Autograph stands out for broad bonus categories. You pay $0 annual fee, and
              can redeem points for flights, hotels, and more.{' '}
              <strong>Cell phone protection</strong> is also included if you pay your monthly phone
              bill with this card.
            </p>

            <h3>c) Discover it® Miles</h3>
            <p>
              A unique approach: <strong>unlimited 1.5 miles per dollar</strong> on everything, plus{' '}
              <strong>Miles Match</strong>—Discover doubles your miles at the end of your first
              year. No annual fee, no foreign transaction fee, and easily redeemable miles for any
              travel purchase. The main caveat is Discover’s acceptance might not be as global as
              Visa or Mastercard, but for domestic use, it’s excellent.
            </p>

            <h3>d) Capital One VentureOne Rewards</h3>
            <p>
              The no-fee sibling of the Venture card, <strong>VentureOne</strong> still offers 1.25
              miles on all purchases, plus 5x miles on hotel and car rental bookings made via
              Capital One Travel. Although it’s not as high as 2x miles from the paid Venture,
              you’re paying $0 for life. You also keep the flexible redemption with miles that can
              be used to erase travel purchases or transfer to select airline/hotel partners.
            </p>

            <h3>e) Delta SkyMiles® Blue American Express Card</h3>
            <p>
              If you’re partial to <strong>Delta</strong> but don’t want an annual fee, the Blue
              Amex is a solid starter. Earn 2x miles at restaurants globally, 2x on Delta purchases,
              and 1x miles on everything else. While it lacks free checked bags (like the paid Delta
              cards), it’s a good no-fee way to build up SkyMiles.
            </p>

          {/* SECTION 4 */}
          <section id="redemption-strategies" className={styles.reviewSection}>
            <h2>4. Redemption Strategies &amp; Tips</h2>
            <h3>1. Combine with a Premium Card Ecosystem</h3>
            <p>
              Some issuers (e.g., Chase, Amex) let you combine points from a no-fee card with those
              from a premium card. That synergy can multiply your redemption values. For example,
              pairing a <strong>Chase Freedom Unlimited</strong> (which has no annual fee, though
              not strictly marketed as a travel card) with a{' '}
              <strong>Chase Sapphire Preferred</strong> can lead to bigger statement credit or
              travel portal redemption rates.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Apply the “Everyday Spend” Method</h3>
            <p>
              A no-fee card with a flat 1.5–2% on all purchases can serve as your “everything else”
              card. Then, you can reassign major travel or dining categories to a specialized card
              if you’d like. This ensures you’re always earning at least 1.5–2% back or miles,{' '}
              <em>never</em> paying an annual fee.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Maximize Intro Bonuses</h3>
            <p>
              Even no-fee cards often have sign-up bonuses worth $200–$300 or ~20k–30k points. If
              you’re strategic about meeting minimum spend requirements, these bonuses can easily
              fund a short domestic flight or offset a few nights at a mid-tier hotel. That’s free
              money for $0 cost yearly.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Watch Transfer Partners (When Available)</h3>
            <p>
              Some no-fee cards let you transfer points to airlines or hotels. E.g., Capital One
              VentureOne or certain co-branded airline/hotel no-fee cards. Transfer partners can
              boost your redemption value if you find sweet spots or promotional awards.
            </p>
          </section>

          {/* SECTION 5 */}
          <section id="common-questions" className={styles.reviewSection}>
            <h2>5. Common Questions &amp; Pitfalls</h2>

            <h3>“Are No-Fee Travel Cards Suitable for International Trips?”</h3>
            <p>
              Check if the card charges a <strong>foreign transaction fee</strong>—some do, some
              don’t. Many top no-fee travel cards (like Capital One, Discover, or some from BoA)
              <strong> don’t</strong> charge these fees, making them safe for global use. But verify
              it in your card’s terms; if it’s 3%, you might lose your travel reward advantage on
              overseas purchases.
            </p>

            <h3>“Is the Credit Limit Too Low for Expensive Travel?”</h3>
            <p>
              Not necessarily. Issuers look at your credit history, income, and credit usage. You
              can often <strong>request a credit limit increase</strong> after 6–12 months. If you
              travel frequently and pay on time, you might see your limit grow significantly, even
              with a no-fee card.
            </p>

            <h3>“Do They Lack Insurance Protections?”</h3>
            <p>
              Some no-fee cards still provide trip delay or baggage insurance. The coverage might be
              more limited than premium travel cards, but it can be enough for occasional travelers.
              Always read the benefits guide to confirm coverage levels.

            <h2>6. Expert Advice for Maximizing Rewards</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Combine Cards Strategically:</strong> If you have a premium card from the
                same issuer, route certain categories to your no-fee card, then pool points into the
                premium card’s travel portal or transfer partners.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Autopay Key Bills:</strong> Earn guaranteed monthly miles by paying phone
                or utility bills with your no-fee card. If there’s cell phone protection or extra
                bonus categories, even better.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Match Sign-Up Bonus Timings:</strong> Plan sign-up bonuses around large
                expenses (holiday shopping, big trips) to meet the minimum spend quickly and
                painlessly, ensuring you get the reward fast.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Monitor Promotions &amp; Offers:</strong> Issuers periodically run bonus
                categories or offers that can boost your no-fee card earnings to 5–10% in certain
                months. Checking your account or “offers” tab can reveal hidden deals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Review Yearly to Assess Value:</strong> Even though there’s no annual fee,
                ensure you’re using it effectively. If you see a better no-fee card with higher
                everyday earn or bigger sign-up bonus, you can consider switching or adding it to
                your wallet.

              miles/points, help you claim a <strong>solid sign-up bonus</strong>, and even provide
              useful benefits like <strong>cell phone insurance</strong> or{' '}
              <strong>no foreign transaction fees</strong>—all while keeping your out-of-pocket

              calculations on an annual fee, these free cards can be a perfect fit. Combine them
              with the right strategy—like funneling everyday spend or leveraging sign-up
