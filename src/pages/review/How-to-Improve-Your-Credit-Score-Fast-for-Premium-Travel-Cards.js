            <h2>1. Key Factors Affecting Your Credit Score</h2>
            <p>
              Before jumping into actionable tips, let’s clarify the main components of your credit
              score. In the U.S., the most commonly used score is FICO, which weighs several
              categories:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Payment History (35%)</strong>: Whether you’ve paid past credit accounts on
                time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Credit Utilization (30%)</strong>: How much of your available credit you’re
                using.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Length of Credit History (15%)</strong>: The age of your oldest and newest
                accounts, plus the average age of all accounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Credit Mix (10%)</strong>: Having a variety of credit products (installment
                loans, credit cards, mortgages).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>New Credit/Inquiries (10%)</strong>: The number of new accounts and recent
                hard inquiries.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <b><em>Payment history</em></b> and <b><em>credit utilization</em></b> make up a combined 65% of
              your score, so focusing on <b><em>on-time payments</em></b> and lowering balances can yield
              substantial improvements. However, the other factors also play crucial roles—
              especially if you’re aiming for the <b><em>700+</em></b> range that premium travel cards
              typically demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many lenders—like Chase, American Express, and Capital One—want to see:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>No serious delinquencies (like 90+ day late payments) in the past year or two.</li>
              <li>A <b><em>healthy “credit utilization ratio”</em></b> below ~30%.</li>
              <li>
                A decently aged credit history (not all new accounts in the last 6 months).
              </li>
              <li>Limited “hard pulls” or new credit inquiries in the last year.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Step-by-Step Plan to Improve Your Score</h2>
            <p>
              Now that you know what matters, here’s a practical roadmap to boosting your credit
              score as quickly and effectively as possible.
            </p>

            <h3>A. Pull Your Credit Reports &amp; Dispute Errors</h3>
            <p>
              Begin by obtaining your credit reports from the three major bureaus (Equifax,
              Experian, TransUnion). You’re entitled to at least one free report per year from each
              bureau at{' '}
              <a
                href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com"
                target="_blank"
                rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"
              >
                AnnualCreditReport.com
              </a>
              . Scrutinize every line for inaccuracies, such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Incorrect payment statuses (e.g., a payment marked late when it was on time).
              </li>
              <li>Accounts that aren’t yours (possible identity theft or mix-ups).</li>
              <li>Duplicate negative items reported across multiple lines.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Dispute these errors immediately. Correcting just one serious misreporting issue—like
              a false delinquency—can raise your score by tens of points within a few weeks.
            </p>

            <h3>B. Prioritize Payment History</h3>
            <p>
              <b><em>On-time payments</em></b> have the biggest impact on your score. If you have any
              overdue bills, bring them current ASAP. Set up automatic payments or reminders to
              ensure you never miss another due date. <b><em>Tip:</em></b> Even a single 30-day late payment
              can linger on your report for seven years, but its effect diminishes over time with
              consistent on-time payments moving forward.
            </p>

            <h3>C. Reduce Credit Utilization</h3>
            <p>
              Aim to keep your credit usage below 30%, or even 10% for optimal scoring. For instance,
              if you have $10,000 in total credit limits, strive to keep balances at ~$3,000 or
              less. <strong>Strategies</strong> to lower utilization:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pay down balances aggressively (start with the highest-interest cards).</li>
              <li>
                Request credit limit increases (only if it won’t trigger a hard pull and you avoid
                new debt).
              </li>
              <li>
                Spread charges across multiple cards instead of maxing out one.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>D. Address Collection Accounts</h3>
            <p>
              If you have collections on your report, contact the agency to discuss pay-for-delete
              or settlement. Sometimes paying in full can lead to the removal of the negative
              listing (though results vary). Getting rid of a collection can yield a noticeable
              score jump—just be sure to get agreements in writing before sending any funds.
            </p>

            <h3>E. Add Positive Accounts (Credit Builder Loans or Secured Cards)</h3>
            <p>
              If your credit file is thin or you have a history of missed payments, opening a
              secured credit card or credit builder loan can demonstrate responsible use going
              forward. These accounts typically report to all three bureaus and help build payment
              history. Just be sure not to open too many new accounts at once, as that can
              temporarily lower your score via additional inquiries.
            </p>

            <h3>F. Limit New Hard Inquiries</h3>
            <p>
              Each new hard pull (like a credit card application) can ding your score a few points.
              If you’re planning a mortgage, auto loan, or premium travel card application soon,
              avoid unnecessary checks. Consolidate rate shopping for big loans within a 14–45 day
              window so it counts as a single inquiry under most FICO models.
            </p>

            <h3>G. Monitor Progress &amp; Rinse/Repeat</h3>
            <p>
              Improving credit is an ongoing process. Use free services like Credit Karma
              (VantageScore) or Experian’s monitoring to watch for changes. Keep paying on time,
              reduce balances, correct errors, and in a few months, your score should reflect these
              positive actions.

            <p>
              There’s no magic formula to gain 100 points overnight, but consistent effort can pay
              off quicker than you think. Here’s a general timeline:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Within 30 Days</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Disputing significant errors can remove them from your report.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Paying down high balances before statement cuts can drop utilization quickly.
                  </li>
                  <li>Bringing a missed payment current can stop further damage.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>2–3 Months</strong>:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Several on-time payments in a row begin offsetting older late payments.
                  </li>
                  <li>Credit limit increases (if granted) reduce utilization.</li>
                  <li>A modest score bump if negative entries were removed.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Negative items start to age, reducing their impact.</li>
                  <li>Consistent low balances improve your credit profile reliability.</li>
                  <li>
                    Secured card or builder loan track record shows positive payment history.

              </li>

                  <li>A year of no missed payments can overshadow older delinquencies.</li>
                  <li>Fewer recent inquiries if you’ve limited new credit.</li>
                  <li>
                    Possible jump from fair (580–669) to good (670–739) or even excellent (740+),

            <h2>5. Maintaining Good Credit Over the Long Haul</h2>
            <p>
              Once you’ve boosted your score into the good or excellent range, you’ll want to keep
              it there to maintain access to the best cards and interest rates. Here are a few
              practices:
            </p>

            <h3>A. Keep Older Accounts Open</h3>
            <p>
              Closing old credit cards can shorten your history and raise utilization. If the card
              has no or low annual fee, keep it open to help your average age of accounts.
            </p>

            <h3>B. Mind Your Utilization</h3>
            <p>
              Even if your score is solid, running up balances too high on a single card can cause
              dips. Spread out charges and consider paying large purchases before the statement
              closes.
            </p>

            <h3>C. Keep Applications Strategic</h3>
            <p>
              Space out new credit applications by a few months, especially if aiming for a premium
              travel card soon. Too many new accounts/inquiries at once can lower your score
              temporarily.
            </p>

            <h3>D. Set Up Alerts &amp; Autopay</h3>
            <p>
              Life gets busy. Autopay ensures you never miss due dates, and alerts remind you of
              statements or suspicious activity.
            </p>

            <h3>E. Periodically Check Your Reports</h3>
            <p>
              Errors or old issues can pop back up. Checking your credit reports 1–2 times a year
              helps you catch and dispute problems early.

          <section id="faqs-credit-score" className={styles.reviewSection}>
            <h2>6. FAQs: Improving Credit &amp; Travel Cards</h2>

            <h3>Q1: Should I pay off credit card balances in full or just keep them under 30%?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>A1:</strong> Paying in full avoids interest and shows minimal utilization. If
              that’s not possible, try staying below 30%, ideally 10% for a top-tier impact.
            </p>

            <h3>Q2: Will closing a card with an annual fee help my score?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>A2:</strong> Not necessarily. Closing a card reduces overall available credit
              and might shorten your account age. If the fee is too high, consider downgrading
              instead of closing.
            </p>

            <h3>Q3: How often do credit scores update?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>A3:</strong> Usually every 30 days as lenders report data. Major changes (like
              removing a negative item) might reflect sooner if the bureaus update quickly.
            </p>

            <h3>Q4: What if I have no credit history at all?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>A4:</strong> Starting with a secured card or becoming an authorized user can
              help you build history. After 3–6 months, you’ll develop a score, and within a year
              you could qualify for an entry-level rewards card.
            </p>

            <h3>Q5: Are credit repair companies worth it?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>A5:</strong> Most actions they take—disputing errors, negotiating with
              creditors, goodwill letters—can be done on your own. Be cautious of quick-fix
              promises; legitimate credit building takes consistent effort.
